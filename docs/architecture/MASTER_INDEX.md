## 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

### Key Concepts Summary

**Pure Function:**
Same input → Same output, No side effects

**Invariant:**
Rule that MUST NEVER be violated
Example: Balance >= 0

**Liquidation:**
Forced position closure when equity < maintenance margin
NOT when balance = 0

**Three-Layer Architecture:**
Frontend → Backend → Database
Frontend NEVER decides truth

**Margin Calculation:**
Initial Margin = Position Size ÷ Leverage

**Equity Calculation:**
Equity = Balance + Unrealized PnL

**Margin Level:**
Margin Level = (Equity ÷ Used Margin) × 100

### Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start coding without understanding
- Put business logic in frontend
- Mix calculation with side effects
- Skip writing tests
- Let AI architect your system
- Restart when facing challenges

✅ **DO:**
- Read sections in order
- Complete all checklists
- Write tests first
- Document decisions
- Keep layers separate
- Refactor instead of restart

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't understand Section X"
**Solution:**
1. Re-read slowly
2. Take notes in your own words
3. Draw diagrams
4. Explain to rubber duck
5. Look up referenced concepts
6. Do NOT proceed until clear

### "This seems like too much work"
**Reality Check:**
- Reading: 10-15 hours
- Planning: 10-15 hours
- Total prep: 25-30 hours

**Without this prep:**
- Restart #1: 40 hours wasted
- Restart #2: 60 hours wasted
- Restart #3: 80 hours wasted
- Still not done: Priceless

**Choice is yours.**

### "Can I skip to the code?"
**Short Answer:** No

**Long Answer:** 
The code is the EASIEST part. The hard part is:
- Knowing what to build
- Knowing where to put it
- Knowing it's correct

This blueprint solves that.

Skip it = guaranteed restart.

### "AI can do this faster"
**Reality:**
AI can write code fast.
AI cannot:
- Understand your business rules
- Design your architecture
- Know your invariants
- Make strategic decisions
- Debug when things break

You must understand.
AI assists.
