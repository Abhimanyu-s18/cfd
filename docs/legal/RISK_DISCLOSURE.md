# RISK DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

---

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This is a PAPER TRADING platform using virtual funds. No real money is at risk.

However, this platform simulates real trading conditions, including:
- Real market prices
- Leverage (which magnifies both gains and losses)
- Market volatility
- Potential total loss of virtual capital

## UNDERSTANDING LEVERAGE

Leverage allows you to control positions larger than your account balance.

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Leverage: 1:100
- You can control: $1,000,000 in positions
- A 1% market move = $10,000 gain or loss
- You could lose your entire virtual account in ONE trade

## KEY RISKS

1. **Total Loss**: You can lose all virtual funds in your account
2. **Leverage Risk**: High leverage amplifies losses
3. **Market Risk**: Prices can move rapidly against you
4. **Liquidation**: Positions automatically close if margin too low
5. **Gap Risk**: Markets can "gap" (jump in price) over weekends
6. **Technical Risk**: Platform outages, delays, errors

## PAST PERFORMANCE

Past performance is NOT indicative of future results.
Profitable demo trading does NOT guarantee real trading success.

## NO INVESTMENT ADVICE

This platform does NOT provide:
- Investment advice
- Financial recommendations
- Trading signals
- Guaranteed returns

- ☐ I understand this is paper trading with virtual money
- ☐ I understand leverage risks
- ☐ I understand I can lose all virtual funds
